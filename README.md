Inspiration
The inspiration behind ECOSLAM stems from the idea of turning waste management into a fun and engaging activity. We wanted to create a game that not only educates people about the importance of recycling and proper waste disposal but also motivates them to take action in their communities.

What it does
ECOSLAM is a unique twist on the classic game of slam, but instead of using balls, players use various types of waste items. The game is played in a specially designed arena where participants compete to throw their waste items into designated bins, earning points for accuracy and speed. It's a fun and interactive way to promote environmental awareness while also fostering a sense of camaraderie among players.

How we built it
We built ECOSLAM using a combination of recycled materials and technology. The arena was constructed using repurposed materials such as old tires, cardboard, and plastic bottles, while the scoring system and game mechanics were implemented using microcontrollers and sensors. The game's interface was developed using a combination of programming languages and software tools to ensure smooth gameplay and user experience.

Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we encountered was designing the arena to accommodate different types of waste items while still ensuring fair gameplay. We also faced technical challenges with integrating the scoring system and sensors, as well as optimizing the game's performance for a seamless experience.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully creating a game that not only entertains but also educates and inspires positive change. Seeing players engage enthusiastically with ECOSLAM and witnessing their increased awareness of waste management issues has been incredibly rewarding for our team.

What we learned
Through the development of ECOSLAM, we learned a great deal about the importance of creative problem-solving, teamwork, and the power of gamification in promoting social and environmental causes. We also gained valuable insights into waste management practices and the potential impact of interactive experiences on behavior change.

What's next for ECOSLAM
Moving forward, we plan to expand the reach of ECOSLAM by hosting events and tournaments in communities around the world. We also aim to further enhance the game's features and accessibility, leveraging feedback from players to improve and iterate upon the experience. Ultimately, our goal is to continue spreading awareness about waste management and environmental sustainability in a fun and engaging way.
